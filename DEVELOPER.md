## Setup
* Affirm supports US based merchants and USD currency

## Sandbox Test Values
* When checking out with Affirm Sandbox, use your real name.  Trying things like "Mister Panda" will not work. As Affirm's name filter
takes out prefixes like Mister and will throw an error when you try to pass things like Mister Panda as the name. Try a regular
name and it should work fine.
* Use a real cell phone number
* Use a real birthday
* Use 1234 for the last 4 of the SSN
* Use 1234 for the pin
